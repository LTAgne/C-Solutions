#Collections Part 1 Exercises

This exercise is made up of 10 coding problems. Each problem is independent of the others, and may be solved in any order.

**Note, If you find yourself stuck on a problem for longer than fifteen minutes, move onto the next, and try again later.**

C# source code has been provided for you in this repository. Please fork the repository, and import the code into a new project in your local Eclipse workspace.


**If you have any questions, or concerns, please see one of the instructors.**
